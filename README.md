# MovieGuru

Welcome to the Movie-Guru gem. This gem was made to find the top rated, most popular, and trending movies. Movie-Guru can also search for a movie by name and return information about a certain movie.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'movie_guru'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install movie_guru

## Usage

The top menu gives you a choice of which movies to find information. You can select from Top Rated movies, Most popular movies, Trending movies, or you can search for your own movie by the name. If you are using the first 3 options then please select which option you want, then select the movie you want out of the returned list. If you are using the search option, please enter the name of the movie that you would like to find. After entering the movie name, you can choose from the list that comes up. The information for the movie will show once a selection is made.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
